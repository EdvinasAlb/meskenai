                Gollum, originally named Sm√©agol (or Trahald), was a Stoor, one of the three early Hobbit-types in the
                Third Age.

                By possessing the One Ring, his life extended centuries beyond his nature, and he became deformed and
                twisted in body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. He pursued the Ring for many years after Bilbo
                Baggins found it in Gollum's cave, within the Misty Mountains, and took it away. Inadvertently, Gollum
                would play a vital role in the ultimate Quest of the Ring. The name Gollum was derived from the sound of
                his gurgling, choking cough.
