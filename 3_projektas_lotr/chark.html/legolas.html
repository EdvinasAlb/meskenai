            Legolas was a Sindar Elf who joined the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age. Son of the Elvenking
            Thranduil of Mirkwood, Legolas was Mirkwood's prince, a messenger, and a master archer. With his keen
            eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was valuable to the Fellowship in their
            journey across Middle-earth. He was well-known for becoming friends with the Dwarf Gimli, despite their
            long-held differences.
