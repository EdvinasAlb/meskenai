                Sauron (Quenya; [ˈsaʊron] or [ˈθaʊron]), the eponymous Lord of the Rings, was the greatest subversive
                Maia, maker of the One Ring, renowned disciple of the Vala Aulë, and chief agent of Morgoth in the Elder
                Days. After Morgoth's ousting by the Valar, Sauron became the second Dark Lord and sought to conquer
                Middle-earth, and even Númenor, through guileful trickery, with the Rings of Power or with overwhelming
                legions.

                At the end of the Second Age, Sauron caused the Downfall of Númenor, and was then defeated in Mordor in
                the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men united under Gil-galad and Elendil. In the final battle,
                Isildur managed to cut the One Ring from him, dismantling his corporeal form and robbing him of much of
                his power. After centuries lying dormant, rebuilding strength and stirring awake evil things, Sauron
                returned to power late in the Third Age, but was vanquished at the destruction of his Ring in Mount
                Doom, by Frodo Baggins.

            To the Sindar of Beleriand, Sauron was known as Gorthaur in the First Age.
