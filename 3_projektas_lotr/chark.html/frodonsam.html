                Frodo Baggins, son of Drogo Baggins, was a hobbit of the Shire in the late Third Age. He is commonly
                considered Tolkien's most renowned character for his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he
                bore the One Ring to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best friend to his
                gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and was one of three hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost
                West at the end of the Third Age.

                Samwise Gamgee, known as Sam, was a hobbit of the Shire. He was Frodo Baggins' gardener and best friend.
                Sam proved himself to be Frodo's closest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the Fellowship
                of the Ring, and played a critical role in protecting Frodo and destroying the One Ring.
