            Gandalf, known temporarily as the Grey and later the White, and originally named Ol√≥rin (Quenya), was an
            Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin
            II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the
            Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
