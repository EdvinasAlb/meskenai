            Gimli, son of Gl√≥in, was a Dwarf of the House of Durin and a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. Unlike
            other Dwarves, he readily fought alongside Elves in the War of the Ring against Sauron at the end of the
            Third Age. After the defeat of Sauron, in the early Fourth Age, he was given the lordship over the
            Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep, which he presided over until he departed from Middle-earth.
