                The Balrogs, or Valaraukar (singular Valarauko, Quenya for "Demon of power"), were a group of three
                to seven Maiar who were seduced and corrupted by Melkor into his service.

                The Balrogs were exceptionally powerful creatures. It took at least all three or at most all seven
                Balrogs to drive away Ungoliant, a large spider powerful enough to devour the fruits of Telperion (the
                "Silver Tree of Valinor"), which produced the light for billions of stars.
